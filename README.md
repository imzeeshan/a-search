## Search Implementation

This project implements a multi-source educational content search system that aggregates results from PBS, CK12, and Khan Academy. Here's how it works:

### Architecture

- **Frontend**: Next.js App Router with React components for search interface
- **Backend**: Serverless API routes handling search requests
- **Database**: Supabase for storing and managing search results

### Search Flow

1. **User Input**
   - Users enter search terms in the search interface
   - Real-time validation and input sanitization

2. **API Processing**
   - Parallel requests to multiple educational content sources
   - Results aggregation and relevancy ranking
   - Caching mechanism for improved performance

3. **Results Display**
   - Dynamic loading states during search
   - Paginated results with infinite scroll
   - Rich content previews with thumbnails

### Key Features

- Multi-source search aggregation
- Real-time search suggestions
- Advanced filtering options
- Responsive design for all devices
- Accessibility compliance

### Usage Example

1. Navigate to the search page
2. Enter your search query
3. Results will load automatically
4. Use filters to refine results
5. Click on results to view full content

## Search Relevancy
I've improved the search relevance by implementing PostgreSQL's powerful full-text search capabilities. Here's what changed:

Better Text Matching:
Added word stemming (e.g., "teach" matches "teacher", "teaching")
Improved partial word matching
Handles multiple words in search query
Weighted Search:
Title matches have higher weight (A)
Description matches have lower weight (B)
Results are ordered by relevance score
Ranking Algorithm:
Uses ts_rank to calculate relevance
Combines exact matches and fuzzy matches
Orders results by relevance score first, then creation date
Search Query Processing:
Normalizes search queries (lowercase, trim)
Splits into words and creates proper tsquery
Handles empty queries gracefully
Now when you search:

Results with title matches appear first
Similar words are matched (e.g., "teach" finds "teaching")
Multi-word queries work better (e.g., "science experiment")
Results are ordered by relevance to your query
Try searching with:

Single words (e.g., "math")
Partial words (e.g., "sci" for science)
Multiple words (e.g., "biology experiment")
Related terms (e.g., "teach" for teaching resources)
The results should be much more relevant to your search terms now.
